ARM Trusted Firmware changes
****************************

This patch updates the system suspend mode for the AM62L platform. After making the following changes,
re-build the ARM Trusted Firmware and then re-package it in the :file:`tispl.bin` file to ensure
the changes take effect. To learn more about TF-A and how to rebuild it, see :ref:`foundational-components-atf`.
For rebuilding U-Boot and generating the new :file:`tispl.bin` follow :ref:`Build-U-Boot-label`.

This modifies :file:`plat/ti/k3/common/am62l_psci.c`, which is the new Power
State Coordination Interface (PSCI) driver for AM62L in Arm Trusted Firmware.
The :func:`am62l_pwr_domain_suspend` function will change the default system
suspend mode from Deep Sleep to RTC Only + DDR.

The default mode of 0 is the Deep Sleep state. Deep Sleep provides the lowest
latency wake-up but also uses more power. The updated default mode of 6 is
the RTC only + DDR state. In contrast, RTC only + DDR offers a lower power
consumption profile, but at the cost of higher wake-up latency.

This change is a temporary solution. A more robust solution is under development to pass a suspend parameter from the kernel
by leveraging the s2idle mechanism.

Once :file:`tispl.bin` is rebuilt and packaged, continue with entering LPM as described in :ref:`lpm_modes`.
