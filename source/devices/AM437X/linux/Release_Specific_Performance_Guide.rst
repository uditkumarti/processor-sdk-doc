System Benchmarks
-------------------

LMBench
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
LMBench is a collection of microbenchmarks of which the memory bandwidth 
and latency related ones are typically used to estimate processor 
memory system performance. More information about lmbench at
https://lmbench.sourceforge.net/whatis_lmbench.html and
https://lmbench.sourceforge.net/man/lmbench.8.html

**Latency**: lat_mem_rd-stride128-szN, where N is equal to or smaller than the cache
size at given level measures the cache miss penalty. N that is at least
double the size of last level cache is the latency to external memory.

**Bandwidth**: bw_mem_bcopy-N, where N is equal to or smaller than the cache size at
a given level measures the achievable memory bandwidth from software doing
a memcpy() type operation. Typical use is for external memory bandwidth
calculation. The bandwidth is calculated as byte read and written counts
as 1 which should be roughly half of STREAM copy result.

Execute the LMBench with the following:

::

    cd /opt/ltp
    ./runltp -P j721e-idk-gw -f ddt/lmbench -s LMBENCH_L_PERF_0001

Dhrystone
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Dhrystone is a core only benchmark that runs from warm L1 caches in all
modern processors. It scales linearly with clock speed.

Please take note, different run may produce different slightly results.
This is advised to run this test multiple times in order to get maximum 
performance numbers.

Execute the benchmark with the following:

::

    runDhrystone

.. csv-table:: Dhrystone Benchmarks
    :header: "Benchmarks","am43xx-gpevm: perf"

    "cpu_clock (mhz)","1000.00"

    "dhrystone_per_second (dhrystonep)","3952941.28 (min 3921568.80, max 4000000.00)"

Whetstone
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Whetstone is a benchmark primarily measuring floating-point arithmetic performance.

Execute the benchmark with the following:

::

    runWhetstone

.. csv-table:: Whetstone Benchmarks
    :header: "Benchmarks","am43xx-gpevm: perf"

    "whetstone (mips)","3333.30"

Linpack
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Linpack measures peak double precision (64 bit) floating point performance in
solving a dense linear system.

NBench
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
NBench which stands for Native Benchmark is used to measure macro benchmarks
for commonly used operations such as sorting and analysis algorithms.

    "string_sort (iterations)","65.07 (min 64.98, max 65.10)"

Stream
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
STREAM is a microbenchmark for measuring data memory system performance without
any data reuse. It is designed to miss on caches and exercise data prefetcher
and speculative accesses.
It uses double precision floating point (64bit) but in
most modern processors the memory access will be the bottleneck.
The four individual scores are copy, scale as in multiply by constant,
add two numbers, and triad for multiply accumulate.
For bandwidth, a byte read counts as one and a byte written counts as one,
resulting in a score that is double the bandwidth LMBench will show.

Execute the benchmark with the following:

::

    stream_c

.. csv-table:: Stream Benchmarks
    :header: "Benchmarks","am43xx-gpevm: perf"
